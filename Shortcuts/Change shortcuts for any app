Go to system preferences--> Keyboard --> Shortcuts --> App Shortcuts
Click on '+', Select the app, set the Menu Title exactly as it appears in the menu of the app then set the shortcut.

For instance for Preview, select Preview and the Menu Title like 'Highlight Text' then create the shortcut.
Done

If it is a command under a submenu just type in 'Menu Title' space as for example:
File->Export->Sub-item

with the '->' symbol to indicate a submenu.
