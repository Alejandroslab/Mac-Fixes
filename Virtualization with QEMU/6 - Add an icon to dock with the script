Follow the instruction in Mac Terminal Repo to create an icon to your dock with a qemu script

remmeber only this:

for the QEMU script you need to specify the disk path fully and you cannot use the '~' to indicate the homefolder!

therefore the line:

-drive file=ubuntu-desktop-18.04.qcow2,if=virtio \

must become

-drive file=/Users/MyUser/QEMU/ubuntu-desktop-18.04.qcow2,if=virtio \

otherwise the script will not work as it will be opened in Terminal and terminal will not know where is the 'ubuntu-desktop....qcow2' file by default
