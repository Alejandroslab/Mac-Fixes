Follow the instruction in Mac Terminal Repo to create an icon to your dock with a qemu script

remmeber only this:

for the QEMU script you need to specify the disk path fully and you cannot use the '~' to indicate the homefolder!

therefore the line:

-drive file=ubuntu-desktop-18.04.qcow2,if=virtio \

must become

-drive file=/Users/MyUser/QEMU/ubuntu-desktop-18.04.qcow2,if=virtio \

otherwise the script will not work as it will be opened in Terminal and terminal will not know where is the 'ubuntu-desktop....qcow2' file by default


Anyways this could not work well especially when you make changes to your script (like delete a cdrom that was previously inserted)

It seems that when you convert to .app file and then reconvert to .sh you lose some information and then it does not work. To make the script work again just do some edits deleting lines (you can use also vim) then re run it

You will also see that the size of the file will increase

It is nothing to do with the code is just the conversion from .app to .sh and viceversa
