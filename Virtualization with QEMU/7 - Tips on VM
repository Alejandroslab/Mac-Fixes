For arch based vm like garud you need to set the
-vga option with std and run with NVIDIA Drivers when asked in GRUB

You may also want especially for Garuda Black Arch to set up 6gb of RAM

qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -m 6G \
  -vga std \
  -display default,show-cursor=on \

You can also set up the -full-screen option
if it does not resize automatically you have to go to display settings and increase your resolution manually
