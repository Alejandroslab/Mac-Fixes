If you cannot place your script in the dock (left side) you may not have successfully created the wrapper
with the method of changin the extension to .app and then back to .sh

It could happen. and it's a pain

A workaround is to use Automator to create the wrapper

just run it click on 'New' and then 'Application'

after that look for 'Run Shell Script'

leave everything as is (Shell: '/bin/zsh 'and pass input 'to stdin')and type in this code:



cd ~/QEMU
open MyVM.sh



where MyVM.sh is the QEMU sript that we have previously created

The first line is to be sure to having moved to the right folder (the folder in which the script is placed)

Now test it clicking on Run

If it works save it! go to File>Export type in a new and save it where you like

You can now also set an icon with the same procedure (ctrl+i after selecting the application or right click on it and 'Get Info' then paste the icon after selecting the application previous icon)

Finally drag the applicaiton to the dock!

Done!!
