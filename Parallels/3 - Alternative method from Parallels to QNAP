You know that Parallels disks have the format .hdd

QNAP Virtualization Station 3 only supports hard disks that have .img format.

Therefore we need to convert it:

Convert the .hdd to plain format by deselecting Expanding Disk in Virtual Machine -> Configure... -> Hardware -> Hard Disk # -> Edit...
(The Parallels VM must be shutted down)

Then you can just change the extension in the .hdd package from .hds to .dmg or .img.

The problem of this is that if the static space that your Parallels VM uses
is higher than the local space the 'Expanding disk' disable funcionality will not work

I have not tested fully this metod as the problem described occurred to me
