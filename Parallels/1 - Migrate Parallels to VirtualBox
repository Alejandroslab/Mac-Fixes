First thing to do to your Parallels VM: uninstall the Parallels Tools!

You do not need to do anything else
You do not even need to set the disk as non expanding

Then:

To get the disk file from Parallel Desktop, on Mac OS, they are usually under ~/Parallels/*.pvm. The .pvm are the VM files for Parallel Desktop, to get the Diskfile for each vm, just right click each .pvm file and select “Show Package Contents”:

Right click the .hdd file and select “Show Package Contents” again:

the .hds is the file that we need!

Copy it out and rename is with what you want to but with file extension of .hdd


Now you can create a new VM in VirtualBox

Select the RAM and CPU as you wish then:

In the “Hard disk” step, we need to select “Use an existing viryual hard disk file”, and click the file icon on the right hand:
Click the “Add” button and select the “.hdd” file we copied from Parallel Desktop.

After you select the file it will show up in the list. Confim you have it selected and click “Choose”, then click “create”.

Then the VM is created, it should show up the list vm list in the left side of the main VirtualBox screen.

Select your vm and click the “start” button to give it the first run.

NOTE! You may need to emable 'EFI' from settings and in particular from:
Settings->System->Motherboard
Otherwise it will not boot
