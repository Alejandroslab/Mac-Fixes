select all volumes
select GUID partition and then AFPS that is one of the alternative to encrypt the HD
the other alternative is MacOS Journaled file system

Anyways using those file system means that they will only work on apple

it cannot be encrypted a disk after formatting

if you want to encrypt it you have to do at the very beginning


REMEMBER! Mac will not read bitlocker encrypted disks
and cannot write on ntfs hds natively

a solution to this is just to run Parallels and load
the hd in Parallels
