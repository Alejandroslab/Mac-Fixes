Sometimes you will still need fat32.
Although is known that fat32 is a very old file system it still could be
necessary in some system like old routers that only supports external
disk formatted as FAT32..

Anyways just open 'Disk Utility'
click on 'Erase' then select 'MS-DOS FAT' and for scheme
select 'Master Boot Record' that is a scheme from the '80s.
