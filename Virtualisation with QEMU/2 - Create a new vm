Go to the Ubuntu website and download the Ubuntu Desktop 18.04 ISO. Move the ISO to the ~/QEMU folder as it will make the QEMU command easier.

Run the following command to create an 10 GB hard disk (or adjust to your needs) for the virtual machine.

qemu-img create -f qcow2 ~/QEMU/ubuntu-desktop-18.04.qcow2 10G


You should now have a folder containing the Ubuntu ISO and the hard disk which Ubuntu will be installed on.


Now create a start script:

touch ~/QEMU/start.sh

And add the following contents to start.sh

qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -m 4G \
  -vga virtio \
  -display default,show-cursor=on \
  -usb \
  -device usb-tablet \
  -machine type=q35,accel=hvf \
  -smp 2 \
  -cdrom ubuntu-18.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso \
  -drive file=ubuntu-desktop-18.04.qcow2,if=virtio \
  -cpu Nehalem

Change the .iso and the .qcow2 accordingly

You do not need to change the CPU as 'Nehalem seems to work pretty good'

Now make the script executable

cd ~/QEMU
sudo chmod +x start.sh

and start it!

./start.sh


After installing, once the machine is powered off. Remove the following line from the start.sh script:

-cdrom ubuntu-18.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso \


You can increase or decrease the memory with the -m option. The command above assigns 2 GB to the virtual machine.

Ubuntu should now be installed and it should run fast on macOS since we enabled hardware acceleration by specifying the -accel hvf option.


SOME TIPS:


    On first boot after installing Ubuntu, the screen resolution might be too low. Right click on the desktop and open a terminal then run sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade to install updates. Restart the system and the screen should then be big enough to increase the resolution in the Devices section of settings. 1440x900 works best for my MacBook Pro (2017 13.3-inch 2560 x 1600).
    If you need to SSH onto the system, you can add the following settings to the QEMU command: -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -net nic. Then you can connect via ssh user@loclhost -p 2222.
    You can enter and leave full screen by pressing Command + F when the mouse cursor is at the very top of the screen.
