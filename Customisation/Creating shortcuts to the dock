You can create an internet link shortcut and drag it to the dock
You can also set a customised icon to your shortcut

to do that use Firefox, Chrome or Safari

Keep click the lock icon near the address bar and drag to the Desktop

A link file will be created (the extension is .webloc)

To change the icon simply control + i or right click and 'Get Info'

then look for the image that you want as an icon (you can look in the internet for icon images ) and copy it with cmd +c

Go to the Get Info bar click on the little square on the top left
It will be enlighted with a blue color

Now paste your image with cmd+ v

done!
Now close the Get Info window
Now you are able to drag the shortcut to the Dock
REMEMBER you cannot place the shortcut anywhere you want in the Dock
You must place it near the Trash bin in the Documents section

You will not be allowed to place it anywhere else
