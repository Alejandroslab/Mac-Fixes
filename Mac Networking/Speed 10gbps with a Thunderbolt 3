You can buy the QNAP QNA-T310G1S adapter that will allow you to connect with a 10gbps connection using a Thunderbolt 3 port
(this works also with windows but you need to install drivers)

REMEMBER this:
when you connect it the device is not recognized automatically
Go to System Preferences then Network then Click on '+'
Select Thunderbolt Ethernet Slot 1 (the 1 may be 2 or other number accordingly to which port you have connected the adapter )

Then under Configure IPv4 Set it as manually and proceed inserting the IP, subnet and router

You can check that the device is the 10gbps one clicking on 'Advanced' then
'Hardware'.
In Configure set it as 'Manually' you will see then 'Speed: 10Gbase-T' and 'Duplex: full-duplex, flow-control'
Leave this setting as they are except for the MTU that MUST BE SET as 'Jumbo (9000)'

DONE!

The speed test signals around 330-500 MB per second when transfering a file around the LAN (between devices that support 10gbps connection of course)

REMEMBER the cable MUST be THUNDERBOLT 3
You may want to use it in a NAS and it should work but if you use an adapter you may lose performance as USB 3.2 goes at 5 gbps (Thunderbolt 3 can theoretically support 40gbps)
