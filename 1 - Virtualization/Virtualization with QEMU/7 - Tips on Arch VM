For arch based vm like garud you need to set the
-vga option with std and run with NVIDIA Drivers when asked in GRUB

You may also want especially for Garuda Black Arch to set up 6gb of RAM

qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -m 6G \
  -vga std \
  -display default,show-cursor=on \

You can also set up the -full-screen option
but if it does not resize automatically you have to go to display settings and increase your resolution manually

(worked on GarudaBlackArch)


For Linux guests with recent enough upstream kernel, the "-vga virtio" is a better emulated display with the option for VirGL acceleration "-display sdl,gl=on" or "-display gtk,gl=on".
