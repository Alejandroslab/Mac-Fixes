UNLOCK PDF WITH PASSWORD

Briefly, a secured PDF file has two types of password: OWNER and USER.
The OWNER password is used to enforce permissions. 
The USER password is used to open the pdf file.

Sometimes, downloaded pdf (such as your bank statements) are secured/encrypted by default. We can decrypt this even without OWNER password using qpdf.
	1. Make sure qpdf is installed, on Debian-based systems: sudo apt-get install qpdf
	2. Run qpdf --decrypt <source pdf> <destination pdf>

IF THERE IS THE USER PASSWORD THE CODE WILL BE:

qpdf --decrypt "MF.pdf" “FileUnlocked.pdf" --password=insert_here_your_password

Where “MF.pdf” is the source file
“FileUnlocked.pdf” is the name of the file that is unlocked (the name could be whichever you want)
Then “insert_here_your_password” is the USER password that you are supposed to know.


to Unlock MULTIPLE pds with password
you can use cipherbox (only windows)
select your folder with your pdf
insert the password

and click on unlock

the program will replace the files therefore remember to backup your data
